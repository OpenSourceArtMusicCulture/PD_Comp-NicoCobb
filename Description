Title: 22 Yeses
pd file: 22yes
audio recording: yesRecording.wav

The original concept of this project came from me saying the word yes out loud in class, and deciding to check how many different versions of the word yes I could find on soundsnap. When I found out there were a large number of these different yeses on the site, I wanted to see what I could do with them. After downloading several, I noted that I had 22 versions of the word yes (although this was later cut to 20, as two of them did not fit the rhythm of the song). As I had 22 yeses, I decided to take Taylor Swift's 22 and replace all of the lyrics with the word yes instead. This was done by taking all of my yes files, and editing them individually to create new versions of each corresponding to every note in the song. Once I had all of the possible yes note files, I found a youtube video containing every note that corresponded to parts of the song (seen at https://youtu.be/S5ZbLg1lhiQ) and transcribed them into a file with A corresponding to 1, B to 2, etc. With all of these files, I researched to see what pure data containers would work best for iterating through these notes, and found I could store them into an array. Using this array, I created a subpatch that would see what value was being passed in, and then pick a random one of the 20 yeses that corresponded to that note. The song is then played manually by hitting the space bar when a note should be played. This also allows for the patch to be used for any song, so long as the notes are provided in a text file and the user knows when the space bar should be hit.
